# Game Title
Silhoutte art

## Concept
Basically its a game where you paint your ideas freely on a canvas.You can either paint the given
art pieces and learn from them or you can paint your own ideas and save the work

## Gameplay
You have to choose size of the canvas and paint type you can choose the shades of colour freely or you can
even mix colours to form a new colour and you can sell your art work to earn coins and you can unlock
different features using these coins

## Unique Features
you can choose the particular type and shade fo colour you can even use cutouts for the art piece

## Target Audience
people who love painting but do not get proper platform to use different shades of colour and
paint freely

## Art Style & Theme
very colourful and background can be like artworks are placed in an art gallery and people are appreciating
it

## Inspiration
i came across a similar game but it lacked the using different colour it allowed only particular colours or
cutouts which were already stored in game or the limited art pieces which were stored in the game

## Tools or Platforms (Optional)
this should be accessible everywhere painting tools can be added
